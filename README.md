## Introduction
The House Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model. By analyzing various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, the model can provide estimates of house prices.

## Features
Some of the features of this project include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training using advanced machine learning techniques
- Interactive user interface for making predictions
- Data visualization to understand the relationships between features and prices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python (version 3.9)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask
